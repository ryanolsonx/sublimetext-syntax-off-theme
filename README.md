# Syntax Off

Syntax Off is a Sublime Text color scheme that removes syntax highlighting. Two variants are provided, _Syntax Off (Dark)_ and _Syntax Off (Light)_. These are based respectively on the _Monokai_ and _Breakers_ color schemes	distributed with Sublime Text.

## Install

To install it, look for "Syntax Off Color Scheme" in [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Syntax%20Off%20Color%20Scheme).

## Why Syntax Off

There are many reasons why you might want to turn off syntax highlighting. Here are a few I've found:

1. Get things done. No more switching color schemes and trying to find the "perfect" color scheme. Instead, you can simply focus on what's really important: getting things done. In my case, this means programming. For others, this might mean writing.

2. You actually read the code. I've found that when you turn syntax highlighting off, you actually **read** the code.

3. Less distraction. No more getting distracted by loud colors (that sometimes don't make sense.)
